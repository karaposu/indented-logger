## Why Automatic Indentation Based on Module Transitions Isn't Feasible

In a perfect Python world, we might wish for logs to automatically indent whenever the execution flow moves from one module to another. However, this approach faces several challenges:

1. **Stateless Logging System**: The Python logging module processes each log record independently without retaining state between records. It doesn't track the execution flow or module transitions over time.

2. **Concurrency Issues**: In multi-threaded applications, logs from different threads and modules can interleave. Tracking module transitions globally can lead to incorrect indentation and confusion.

3. **Complex Execution Paths**: Applications often have dynamic and non-linear execution flows. Modules may call each other in various orders, making it difficult to determine indentation solely based on module transitions.

Due to these reasons, automatically indenting logs based on module transitions isn't practical or reliable.
